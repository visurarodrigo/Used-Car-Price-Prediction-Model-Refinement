# Used Car Price Prediction

## 📖 Project Overview
This project predicts the selling price of used cars based on various features such as mileage, year, brand, fuel type, and more.  
The model is built and refined using regression techniques including Linear Regression, Polynomial Features, Ridge Regression, and hyperparameter tuning with Grid Search.  

The goal is to create an accurate and reliable price prediction model while demonstrating key data analysis and machine learning concepts from the **IBM Data Analysis with Python** course.
